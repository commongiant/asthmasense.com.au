                a.accordion-toggle(data-toggle="collapse", data-parent="#accordion", href="#collapseOne") Why are asthma rates on the rise in the U.S.?

                p According to a recent report from the Center for Diseases Control, the number of people diagnosed with asthma grew by 4.3 million between 2001 and 2009. The proportion of people of all ages with asthma in the U.S. increased from 7.3% (20.3 million people) in 2001 to 8.2% (24.6 million people) in 2009.
                p The greatest rise in asthma rates was among African-American children, who had a 50% increase from 2001 to 2009, according to the CDC. The highest rate of asthma in 2009 was among African-American children, 17% of whom had asthma.
                p Researchers aren’t exactly sure why rates of asthma have risen, but say that increases in part may reflect improved methods to diagnose the condition.

                p Annual asthma costs in the U.S. were $3,300 per person between 2002 and 2007. Costs are rising too, from $53 billion in 2002 to about $56 billion in 2007, for a 6% increase. There are other economic costs that can be attributed to poor asthma management:
                ul
                  li In 2008, almost 42% of people with asthma said they missed one or more days of school or work because of asthma in the past year.
                  li People who had an asthma attack missed an average of 4.5 days of school or work per year.
                  li 26% of people with asthma reported emergency department or urgent care center visits
                  li 7% were admitted to a hospital for asthma.

              .panel-body
                p Most experts agree on the importance of educating patients to self manage asthma and its attack. Self-management is one of the four key components of effective asthma management listed in the National Institutes of Health guidelines that were developed by National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.
                p Even though an NAEPP expert panel recommends that every person with asthma have an asthma action plan, only one-third of adults and children reported having such a plan. An asthma action plan is developed by health-care providers to address the specific needs and circumstances of an individual patient.
                ul It describes:
                  li how to monitor symptoms, such as wheeze rate
                  li when to change the amount or type of medication
                  li how to identify and avoid exposure to allergens and irritants
                  li how to recognize worsening asthma symptoms
                  li when to take action, such as calling the physician for advice or going to the emergency department

                a.accordion-toggle(data-toggle="collapse", data-parent="#accordion", href="#collapseFour") What does wheeze rate mean and can monitoring help?
            #collapseFour.panel-collapse.collapse
              .panel-body
                p The percentage of your breathing time spent wheezing is called your WheezeRATE&trade;. Monitoring your WheezeRATE can help you determine if your wheezing is stable, increasing, or decreasing.
                p A WheezeRATE that is elevated or increasing can be a sign that you need to use your rescue inhaler or contact your physician. Exercise, weather, climate, use of medication or exposure to allergens also may affect your WheezeRATE.
                p With regular monitoring of your WheezeRATE, you will learn more about your asthma. And better knowledge can lead to better asthma control.

              .panel-body
                p According to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), Internet-based home monitoring, and mobile phones have been shown to be successful modes to improve asthma control. Self-management programs have been tested in diverse groups, including community health workers, pregnant women with asthma, children and adolescents, and in multi-racial populations.

                a.accordion-toggle(data-toggle="collapse", data-parent="#accordion", href="#collapseSix") What about peak flow meters?
            #collapseSix.panel-collapse.collapse
              .panel-body
                p A peak flow meter measures how well your lungs are working. However, compliance with peak flow rate monitoring is limited by the difficulty that patients and their caregivers often have with keeping records. Peak flow rate measurement may be of lower utility in younger children   and elderly patients, but it has been shown to be of greater benefit in children who are poor or are members of minority groups.
                p Compliance with monitoring is also low for adults. In a study of adults, adherence was greatly improved by using an electronic device.
                p Compliance with peak flow rate monitoring is also limited by the lack of ability, on the part of most clinicians, to interpret the data in a meaningful way. Numerous scales and charts are available, but many of them are difficult to interpret.

                p iSonea offers several convenient handheld devices and apps that can help you monitor your asthma and share information about your symptoms. None of these devices and technologies is intended to replace the care of a physician, but can be used to provide immediate information to your doctor and your family about your asthma.
                h5 WheezoMeter&reg;
                p The WheezoMeter uses Acoustic Respiratory Monitoring (ARM™) to record and assess symptoms of breathing distress such as wheezing, one of the principal symptoms of asthma.  The WheezoMeter tells you what percentage of your breathing time is spent wheezing – also called your WheezeRATE. Monitoring your WheezeRATE can help you determine if your wheezing is stable, increasing, or decreasing.
                ul
                  li The WheezoMeter analyzes and records the sounds of your breathing for 30 seconds.
                  li Information about your WheezeRATE is stored in the WheezoMeter so that you can share important information with a family member or your doctor.
                  li Device is placed at the base of your throat; easy and convenient to use.
                  li Available by prescription only.

                p Acoustic Respiratory Monitoring (ARM™) used in the WheezoMeter is a new technology and your doctor may not be familiar with it yet. Numerous clinical studies have been published that demonstrate the value of this monitoring approach in clinical settings such as a doctor’s office or hospital.
