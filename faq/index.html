However, compliance with peak flow rate monitoring is limited by the difficulty that patients and their caregivers often have with keeping records.

In a study of adults, adherence was greatly improved by using an electronic device.</p><p>Compliance with peak flow rate monitoring is also limited by the lack of ability, on the part of most clinicians, to interpret the data in a meaningful way.
