                                    <p>According to a recent report from the
                                    Center for Diseases Control, the number of
                                    people diagnosed with asthma grew by 4.3
                                    million between 2001 and 2009. The
                                    proportion of people of all ages with
                                    asthma in the U.S. increased from 7.3%
                                    (20.3 million people) in 2001 to 8.2% (24.6
                                    million people) in 2009.</p>

                                    <p>The greatest rise in asthma rates was
                                    among African-American children, who had a
                                    50% increase from 2001 to 2009, according
                                    to the CDC. The highest rate of asthma in
                                    2009 was among African-American children,
                                    17% of whom had asthma.</p>

                                    <p>Researchers aren’t exactly sure why
                                    rates of asthma have risen, but say that
                                    increases in part may reflect improved
                                    methods to diagnose the condition.</p>

                                    and its attack. Self-management is one of
                                    the four key components of effective asthma
                                    management listed in the National
                                    Institutes of Health guidelines that were

                                    have an asthma action plan, only one-third
                                    of adults and children reported having such
                                    a plan. An asthma action plan is developed
                                    by health-care providers to address the
                                    specific needs and circumstances of an

                                    <p>A peak flow meter measures how well your
                                    lungs are working. However, compliance with
                                    peak flow rate monitoring is limited by the
                                    difficulty that patients and their
                                    caregivers often have with keeping records.
                                    Peak flow rate measurement may be of lower
                                    utility in younger children and elderly
                                    patients, but it has been shown to be of
                                    greater benefit in children who are poor or
                                    are members of minority groups.</p>

                                    <p>Compliance with monitoring is also low

                                    was greatly improved by using an electronic

                                    monitoring is also limited by the lack of

                                    interpret the data in a meaningful way.

                                    wheezing – also called your WheezeRATE.
                                    Monitoring your WheezeRATE can help you
                                    determine if your wheezing is stable,
